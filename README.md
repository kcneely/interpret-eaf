# interpret-eaf
This script extracts information from an .eaf transcription file and calls ffmpeg to clip a full-length .wav file into .opus files corresponding to each transcription tier segment. The resulting .opus files are named with a numeric prefix corresponding to the line numbers displayed in ELAN's Transcription Mode.
